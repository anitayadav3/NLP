# NLP
This projet consist of 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model. The model is built on housing dataset which has 9 features. Regression is done on the dataset and is split into testing and training set. The accuracy is calculated using the L1 loss and R2 score. The max pooling layer and kernel is used along with convultion layer.
