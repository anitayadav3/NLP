# NLP
This projet consist of 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model. The model is built on housing dataset which has 9 features. Regression is done on the dataset and is split into testing and training set. The accuracy is calculated using the L1 loss and R2 score. The max pooling layer and kernel is used along with convultion layer. A custom method to train the new model in batches is created and let it run for a set number of epochs. Then evaluated model on testing dataset to see how it performs.
